Team SoundHound (Pavel, Gary, and yours truely)

[Fab Lab London Intel Hardware Hackathon](http://fablablondon.org/events/fab-lab-london-intel-hardware-hackathon/)


Unwanted sounds invade your living space.  These include:

   o low levels of continuous noise from passing traffic,

   o distruptive noise from large passing vehicles,

   o occasional event noise, e.g., digging up the street,

   o operating noise from electrical good within a building.


Resident may want to monitor the level of external noise to
provide evidence for ??? complaints...

Over time people learn about the noises in their living space
environment and can become aggitated when an unidentified noise
starts to intrude.

The SoundHound records sound via the vibration induced in
objects such as walls and windows, i.e., noticeable levels of sound.

Data is uploaded to the cloud where it can be displayed and analysed.
The types of analysis include:

   o average background levels,

   o number of events exceeding some threshold,

   o comparison against other recorded sound patterns, suggesting
possible close matches that can help users identify the device
generating the sound, e.g., the sound produced by a given brand of
boiler generates a particular power spectrum.

Can also be used to help localise the source of sounds.

Vibration detector is held aginst various walls...

Data is uploaded to IBM's Bluemix

Correlation of vibration and audio to verify that the
two are correlated, e.g., that there are not two separate
sources that need to be measured.
